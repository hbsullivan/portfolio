  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio, and thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little bit better. As you've probably guessed, my name is Henry Sullivan and I am a new developer hoping to expand my knowledge on the vast topic of computer programming. I grew up in Kansas City, and after a brief stint working in the wine industry in Portland, Oregon, I decided to change careers and try to become a programmer. My experience is minimal, but hopefully over the years this page will improve and grow to reflect what I have learned. If you have any inquiries, or suggestions, please email me at <a href="mailto: sullivanbhenry@gmail.com>"> sullivanbhenry@gmail.com.</a></p>

  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>As mentioned above, I grew up in Kansas City, Kansas. I graduated from college in 2020 with the initial hopes of going to medical school. 2020 was a pretty crazy year, and I decided to hold off on school and instead move to Oregon to work in the wine industry. I spend two years making, serving, studying, and most importantly, drinking wine. I loved working in the wine industry, but quickly found out that it was hard on your body, and decided I needed a career change. That is when I discovered Epicodus, and it seemed like a perfect fit. <strong>Please see below for a detailed education and employment history</strong>.</p>
